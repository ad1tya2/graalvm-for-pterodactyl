# graalvm-for-pterodactyl
This is docker image by me for using in a minecraft server running on pterodactyl.

Right now the java versions i support are java-8, java-11, and java-16
You can get different java versions by changing the branches

Just put `ad1tya2/graalvm:java-11` or the java version you like, `java-8` or `java-16` and put it In the pterodactyl panel `startup` config options and you are done :)
